Introduction
---
This is gradient colour background generator, where the user can choose two different colours to create a gradient bsckground. The CSS code for that combination appears beneath so that the user can use it in their projects. There is also a 'Random Picks' button where the colours will be randomly chosen.

This project is from the "Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery" course on the [Zero-to-Mastery website](https://zerotomastery.io/).

Methodology
---

I followed along with the lesson, really. We were given exercises to complete afterwards, one of which was to add a 'Random' Button to generate random colours. I vagely remember doing a smiliar randomizer many months ago, so I went back to what I did there and incorporated that into my code here.

After completing that, I made some slight adjustments to the colour picker sizes and the design of the button.

* Javascript

What I learned
---
It was fun trying to remember how to do the Random Picker (all my previous efforts to get it to work fell short until I remember the previous exercise I did). 

<br>

Items for further study
---
Well, I need to use `Math.Random()` more, certainly. Also, would like to play around more with gradients in general.

I also want to add a shimmer gradient bakcground to the `Random Picks` button upon hover.
